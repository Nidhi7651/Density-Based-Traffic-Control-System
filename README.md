# Density-Based-Traffic-Control-System
The project is aimed at designing a density based dynamic traffic signal system where the timing of the signal will change automatically on sensing the traffic density at any junction . Present day traffic signaling system is fixed time based which may render inefficient if one lane is operational than the others.
